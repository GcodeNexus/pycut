<h1 class="etitle">PyCut Tutorial</h1>

<h2 id="P-01">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to <strong>PyCut</strong>, a clone of <strong>jsCut</strong>, the
excellent (at least for beginners) CAM, web-based programm, that takes as input
<strong>SVG</strong> files and generates G-Code. So why this rewrite ?</p>

<p><strong>PyCut</strong> aims to offer all the (minimalistics) features found
in jsCut, with some small improvements. Hopefully you will find
<strong>PyCut</strong> usefull when learning CNC and producing your first GCode
files.</p>

<p>Starting point of <strong>PyCut</strong> are <strong>SVG</strong> files,
your designs. In the following, we will use <strong>Inkscape</strong> to
produce <strong>SVG</strong> files, and will shortly point out what has to be
taken into consideration when creating "usable" <strong>SVG</strong> files.</p>

<h3>SVG</h3>

<h4>Shapes</h4>

<p>The SVG standard is large, and <strong>PyCut</strong> cannot simply read a
svg file, display it, and allow the user to define cnc operations on the
"shapes" defined inside the svg file. Of course, the goal of
<strong>PyCut</strong> is to process as many svg data as possible.</p>

<p>The shapes inside a svg file are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;path&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;rect&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;circle&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;ellipse&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;polygon&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;line&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;polyline&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, the user will also want to process the strings written in the svg
file:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;text&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>Because <strong>PyCut</strong> finally processes "paths" in order to
calculate cnc paths, these shapes have to be interpreted/converted first to svg
&lt;path&gt;.</p>

<p>The first possibility is to convert all the shapes and text (strings) found
in your data into &lt;path&gt; shapes only, and then import this &lt;path&gt;
only svg file into <strong>PyCut</strong>.</p>

<p>The second possibility is to only convert the &lt;text&gt; items in
&lt;path&gt; shapes, because <strong>PyCut</strong> actually can internally
convert the other shapes into &lt;path&gt; shapes.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#8000ff">IN PROGRESS</span>:</strong> The second
possibility in to not convert the svg file at all, because
<strong>PyCut</strong> can actually convert all these shapes/text internally.
Nevertheless, special attention should be given to the &lt;text&gt; items. A
successfull conversion will only occurs if the &lt;text&gt; item is simple
enough: the text "value" should not be splitted into several &lt;tspan&gt;
items with different fonts. No &lt;tspan&gt; tag at all is also possible (and
simpler). </p>

<p>All in all, if PyCut were to display text strings at the wrong positions,
the user can always export the svg from Inkscape (and write
<strong>PyCut</strong> a ticket).</p>

<h4>Shapes "id"</h4>

<p>In order to reference the shapes, these shapes must have an "id", hopefully
unique inside the svg document. If the user has edited the svg "per hand", then
he should not forget to give all shapes an unique id. If the user has created
the svg with <strong>Inkscape</strong>, then "id" are automatically given, but
maybe the user will want to edit them and give them meaningfull content.</p>

<h4>Transformations</h4>

<p>It is usual to translate, rotate, scale and skew the shapes. Unfortunately,
<strong>PyCut</strong> cannot handle these transformations. If the user has
used such transformations, then it is possible inside Inkscape to "resolve" the
transformation: just "ungroup" and then "group" again the desired shapes.
During this process, the shapes will be convert into a &lt;path&gt; shapes.</p>

<h3>Inkscape</h3>

<p>With Inkscape, the first step is to specify the "Document size". Please
choose as units "mm", "cm" or "in". This will be use later when creating GCode
with the option "Zero Lower Left of Material" as reference. This option needs
the Y size of the material.</p>

<p>Then, after having creating your design (rectangles, circles, text etc),
convert all the &lt;text&gt; items to "paths".</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2 id="P-02">Basic example</h2>

<h3>Importing a SVG file</h3>

<p>So import your svg into <strong>PyCut</strong>: The SVG content should be
displayed in the central area. </p>

<div class="info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> text is not displayed. It has to be converted as
&lt;path&gt; in order to be procesed by <strong>PyCut</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Creating a PyCut Job</h3>

<p>Then create a new "job" : this is a kind of container that stores the svg
file name, the CAM operations that will be created for this specific svg file,
and all the settings relevant when generating g-code.</p>

<p>Later, after having saved the job, it will be possble to reload it, with all
its stored CAM operations and others settings.</p>

<h3>Creating CAM operations</h3>

<p>Once an empty job is created, it is time to create some CAM operations:
select 1 or more items in SVG window (they should turn beige) and click the
button "Create Operation": a new operation in the operation table should
appear.</p>

<p>Define the properties of the operation: the main one is the CAM operation
type: "Pocket", "Engrave", "Inside" or "Outside". The others options wil be
discussed later. Default values at this point should be Ok.</p>

<h3>Create the GCode</h3>

<p>Select one or more CAM operations in the operations table: the "geometry" of
the operation(s) should turn black in the SVG viewer: this is (are) the
region(s) of the material that wil be affected when cutting the material.</p>

<p>Then finish creating the G-Code by pressing one button "g code" in the
operation table: the tool path(s) should appears in green in the black
regions.</p>

<p>The produced G-Code can be inspected in the "G code viewer" and the "G code
Simulator" display areas.</p>

<p>You just have to save the G-Code and you're done.</p>

<h2>GUI Components</h2>

<h3>Svg Settings</h3>

<h4>px scale factor</h4>

<p>What is this? Let's take an example: in Inkscape, the user would set the
document's size to <strong>100x40 mm</strong>, I suppose the size of the
material to work on. . Inkscape automatically set the <strong>user unit scale
factor</strong> to 1. This means, <strong>1 px is equal to 1 mm (and the
viewbox is "0 0 100 40" while width="100mm" and height="40mm")</strong></p>

<p>Of course when editing the svg (in Inkscape or in a text editor),
<strong>the user in only concerned with the user units</strong>
<strong>(px)</strong>: he draws a rectangle of size 20x30 (px) at the location
10x.10 (px). The users may simply even not be aware of this fact. When choosing
mm, conversion from px to mm is absolutely straightforward as, as said, the
user unit scale factor is 1 per default .</p>

<p>Let's consider now the case where the user switches to
<strong>inches</strong> for the document size. The size of the document is then
<strong>3,93701x1,57480 inches</strong> (100 / 25.4 is 3.93701). Note that
Inkscape automatically change the <strong>user unit scale factor to
25.4</strong>. Because of this, the <strong>view box remains at "0 0 100
40"</strong>. That way, a rectangle filling the full document size is still
100x40 px.</p>

<p>Now how can <strong>PyCut</strong> handles these settings?
<strong>PyCut</strong> only works with the user units <strong>px</strong>.
<strong>PyCut</strong> will calculate paths in the same order of magnitude of
the px values of the svg. If you choose "<strong>mm</strong>" for the gcode
output, you would have set your svg document size in "mm", and the <strong>user
unit (px) scale factor to 1</strong>. Because of this, the gcode X,Y and Z
values are the same as the one of the paths values.</p>

<p>If you choose "<strong>in</strong>" for the gcode output, then certainly you
have set your svg document size in "<strong>in</strong>", and the <strong>user
unit (ps) scale factor is 25.4</strong>. This way, the px values of the svg and
the calculated tool paths are scaled back of a factor of <strong>1 /
25.4</strong> when outputing the gcode. This way, a rectangle of (user unit)
100x40 px will **not** be 100x40 inches large, but only <strong>1 /
25.4</strong> this size, which is OK.</p>

<p>Note that this scale factor is not explicitely given in the svg file. It is
calculated from the ratio viewbox / size. It is eventually the task of the user
to know what is the user scale ratio, especially if his svg is set with
inches.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#0000ff">I personnaly stick to svg document units
in "mm" with user unit (px) scale factor of 1, and output my gcode in mm. No
confusion! </span></strong></p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: The user could use "mm", and set a px scale factor
of 10 or whatever, but it certainly makes no sense. The setting is for users
who wish to output gcode in inches.</p>
</div>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: <strong>PyCut</strong> actually assumes that for
"<strong>mm</strong>" gcode output, the <strong>px scale factor is
1</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p></p>

<h3>Tabs</h3>

<p>It's easy to define tabs with <strong>PyCut</strong>: just click the button
"Create Tab" and a red circle is created in the svg, of radius 5 and position
(10,10). The user can drag 'n drop it fron the svg viewer, or set its
size/postion in the tab table. Yes tabs, for simplicity, are circle. To be
effective, the tabs have to be enabled and of course placed somewhere on the
generated toolpaths. The height of the tab is shared by all tabs.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Tabs shall not overlap with other tabs (at least
the enabled ones).</p>
</div>

<p>You can check the Gcode generation in the viewer/simulator if everythings is
Ok. </p>

<h3>Material</h3>

<p>The Operations "Cut Depth" should be be larger than the material thickness.
</p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Actually no check is performed.</p>
</div>

<h3>Curve to Line Conversion</h3>

<p>If your design contain curves (svg "arcs" or "bezier" curves), they have to
be discretized in small segments.</p>

<p>The 2 following parameters allow to specified how fine the curve
discretization will be</p>
<ul>
  <li>Minimun number of segments</li>
  <li>Segment lenght</li>
</ul>

<h3>GCode Conversion</h3>

<p>The starting location of a milling operation is given by the initial
location in the GCode. Per default, PyCut gives as starting point the (0,0)
coordinates of the SVG file, which is located at the top-left of the material.
This is SVG convention.</p>

<p>But the GCode generation will of course invert the direction of the Y axis
coordinates. But still the reference is the top-left postion.</p>

<p>It is possible to change the reference location of the generated GCode</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bottom-Left location of the material</li>
  <li>Bottom-Left location of the Gcode area</li>
  <li>Center of the Gcode area</li>
</ul>

<p>And further:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flip X/Y </li>
</ul>

<p>In the generated G Code, X and Y are switched.This can be helpfull, for
example in the case your <strong>CNC</strong> is the "<strong>1419</strong>"
model (mine!) which is not as large as deep. So this option allows to carve
something like 16x10 cm without to -painfully- rotate all items in the source
svg.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In case of Bottom-Left location of the material, the Y size of the material
is extracted form the svg file: the svg "height" attribute (with units) </p>

<h3>GCode Generation</h3>

<p>Some useful options can be set up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Return at initial location at end of the Job</li>
  <li>Spindle Start/Stop (<strong>M3</strong>/<strong>M5</strong> codes)</li>
  <li><strong>M2</strong> code</li>
</ul>
