<h1 class="etitle">PyCut Tutorial</h1>

<h2 id="P-01">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to <strong>PyCut</strong>, a clone of <strong>jsCut</strong>, the
excellent (at least for beginners) CAM, web-based programm, that takes as input
<strong>SVG</strong> files and generates G-Code. So why this rewrite ?</p>

<p><strong>PyCut</strong> aims to offer all the (minimalistics) features found
in jsCut, with some small improvements. Hopefully you will find
<strong>PyCut</strong> usefull when learning CNC and producing your first GCode
files.</p>

<p>Starting point of <strong>PyCut</strong> are <strong>SVG</strong> files,
your designs. In the following, we will use <strong>Inkscape</strong> to
produce <strong>SVG</strong> files and will shortly point out what has to be
taken into consideration when creating "usable" <strong>SVG</strong> files for
<strong>PyCut</strong>.</p>

<h3>SVG</h3>

<h4>Shapes</h4>

<p>The SVG standard is large, and <strong>PyCut</strong> cannot simply read a
svg file, display it, and allow the user to define cnc operations on the
"shapes" defined inside the svg file. Of course, the goal of
<strong>PyCut</strong> is to process as many svg data as possible.</p>

<p>The shapes inside a svg file are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;rect&gt;</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;circle&gt;</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;ellipse&gt;</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;polygon&gt;</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;line&gt;</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;polyline&gt;</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The almighty</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;path&gt;</span></li>
</ul>

<p>can define in a single path definition many closed or opened paths, not
nrcessarely related with each others.</p>

<p>Finally, the user will also want to process the strings written in the svg
file:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;text&gt;</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PyCut</strong> processes "paths" in order to calculate cnc paths,
but thankfully it can read out of the box all kind of shapes, so there is
<strong>no need</strong> to convert your svg file into "paths only" svg.</p>

<p><strong>PyCut</strong> will import these shapes either as "<span
style="color:#0000ff">polygon</span>" (i.e. <strong>closed shape</strong>) or
as "<span style="color:#0000ff">line</span>" (i.e. <strong>opened
shape</strong>). Of course, <span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;rect&gt;</span>,
<span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;circle&gt;</span>, <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;ellipse&gt;</span> and <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;polygon&gt;</span> are closed shapes, while <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;line&gt;</span> and <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;polyline&gt;</span> are opened shapes. When importing
a <span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;path&gt;</span>, things are more complicated,
as a path can be composed of many subpaths (starting with
[<strong>Mm</strong>]) and every subpath can be closed or not (ending with
[<strong>Zz</strong>]). <strong>PyCut</strong> will try to import these paths
right, and in case of closed paths will also try to import them as polygons
"<strong>with holes</strong>" even if this concept does not really exist in
SVG. Moreover <strong>PyCut</strong> will try to import a path as a valid
MultiPolygon in the shapely sense, or as a list of valid MultiPolygons if one
single valid MultiPolygon is not possible.</p>

<p>There is one exception: <strong>PyCut</strong> cannot process yet <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;text&gt;</span> items. Fortunately, <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;text&gt;</span> items can be converted into <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;path&gt;</span> items within
<strong>Inkscape</strong>, sonce they will be ignored by
<strong>PyCut</strong>. <strong>PyCut</strong> also comes with the utiilty
<strong>svgtext2svgpath.py</strong> which will also convert your <code><span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;text&gt;</span></code> items. How to use it? just
call the <strong>svgtext2svgpath.py</strong> program which outputs in a new svg
the <span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;text&gt;</span> items as <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;path&gt;</span> items. Copy/paste the result of a
<span style="color:#0000ff">&lt;text&gt;</span> conversion into your own svg. A
successfull conversion will only occurs if the <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;text&gt;</span> item is simple enough: the text
"value" should not be splitted into several <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;tspan&gt;</span> items with different fonts. No <span
style="color:#0000ff">&lt;tspan&gt;</span> tag at all is also possible (and
simpler). <strong><span style="color:#8000ff">IN PROGRESS</span></strong>.</p>

<p>All in all, if <strong>PyCut</strong> were to display text strings at the
wrong positions, the user can always export the svg from
<strong>Inkscape</strong> (and write <strong>PyCut</strong> a ticket).</p>

<h4>Transformations</h4>

<p><strong>PyCut</strong> cannot handle "out of the box" (yet) svg datas where
shapes/paths are defined with "transform" operations (translate, rotate
etc.).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is possible to "resolve" the shapes transformations, as
<strong>PyCut</strong> also comes with the utility
<strong>svgresolver.py</strong>. The <strong>svgresolver.py</strong> program
reads any svg data and outputs a new svg data with all transformations
resolved, while keeping the<strong>"id"</strong>s right. <strong><span
style="color:#8000ff">IN PROGRESS</span></strong>: this utility should be
integrated into <strong>PyCut</strong> so that the user can spare this step.
Actually, this utility is found in the source code under the folder
"<strong>utilities/svgresolver</strong>".</p>

<h2 id="P-02">Svg Documents</h2>

<p>Svg datas can be written with basic editors (vi, emacs etc..) or with real
applications, as <strong>Inkscape</strong>. In both cases, the svg datas should
contains (and <strong>Inkscape</strong> does it automatically) a
<strong>viewBox</strong>, and the svg attributes <strong>width</strong> and
<strong>height.</strong> These 2 important attributes should be given with a
unit, i.e "<strong>mm</strong>" or "<strong>in</strong>" as we are editing data
in order to later generate gcode (with "mm" or "in" units). This will be used
later when creating GCode with the <strong>PyCut</strong> option "Zero Lower
Left of Material" as reference. This option needs the height of the
material.</p>

<h4>Shapes "id"</h4>

<p>In order to reference the shapes, the shapes must have their own
<strong>"id"</strong>, hopefully unique inside the svg document.</p>

<p>If the user has edited the svg "per hand", then he should not forget to give
all shapes an unique id. If the user has created the svg with
<strong>Inkscape</strong>, then "id"s are automatically given, but maybe the
user will want to edit them and give them meaningfull name.</p>

<h4>Writing Svg Files with Inkscape</h4>

<p>With <strong>Inkscape</strong>, the first step is to specify the "Document
size". Please choose as units "<strong>mm</strong>" or "<strong>in</strong>".
<span style="color:#8000ff"><strong>You should also do this when creating a svg
file with a text editor</strong></span>.</p>

<h4>Writing Svg Files with a Text Editor</h4>

<p>Sometimes it is easier to edit a svg file without a graphical app like
Inkscape, but simply with a text editor.</p>

<p>This way, it is easy for example to define shapes in the
<strong>&lt;def&gt;</strong> paragraph and reuse theses shapes in the main body
of the svg file with the help of the <strong>&lt;use&gt;</strong> tag and some
transformations. The utility <strong>svgresolver.py</strong> will have to be
used.</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2 id="P-03">Basic example</h2>

<h3>Opening the PyCut application</h3>

<p>type in the console:</p>

<p><code>&gt; python pycut.py -h</code></p>

<p><code>&gt; python pycut.py [job]</code></p>

<p>Without argument, pycut opens itself. With argument, a previously saved job
is opened.</p>

<p>For the very first time, start pycut without job.</p>

<h3 id="P-03-01">Importing a SVG file</h3>

<p>So import your svg into <strong>PyCut</strong>: The SVG content should be
displayed in the central area. </p>

<div class="info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> text is not displayed inside the
<strong>PyCut</strong> svg viewer. It has to be converted as &lt;path&gt; in
order to be further processed.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="P-03-02">Creating a PyCut Job</h3>

<p>Then create a new "job" : this is a kind of setting file that stores for a
given svg file all the CAM operations that the users has created, together with
all others settings relevant when generating g-code. It can be created, saved
and loaded again and modified - quite practical.</p>

<h3 id="P-03-03">Creating CAM operations</h3>

<p>Once an empty job is created and a svg file loaded, it is time to create
some CAM operations: select 1 or more items in SVG window (they should turn
beige) and click the button "Create Operation": a new operation in the
operation table should appear.</p>

<p>Define the properties of the operation: the main one is the CAM operation
type: "<strong>Pocket</strong>", "<strong>Engrave</strong>",
"<strong>Inside</strong>" or "<strong>Outside</strong>". The others options
will be discussed later. Default values at this point should be Ok.</p>

<h3 id="P-03-04">Create the GCode</h3>

<p>Select one or more CAM operations in the operations table: the "geometry" of
the operation(s) should turn black in the SVG viewer: this is (are) the
region(s) of the material that wil be affected when cutting the material.</p>

<p>Then finish creating the G-Code by pressing one button "g code" in the
operation table: the tool path(s) should appears in green in the black
regions.</p>

<p>The produced G-Code can be inspected in the "G code viewer" and the "G code
Simulator" display areas.</p>

<p>You just have to save the G-Code and you're done. The gcode file should be
named as the CAM operation name.</p>

<h2 id="P-04">GUI Components</h2>

<h3 id="P-04-01">Svg Settings</h3>
<img src="pycut_svgsettings.png" width="310px"> 

<h4>user units scale</h4>

<p>What is this? And why is it disabled and set to 1? Let's take an example: in
<strong>Inkscape</strong>, the user would set the document's size to
<strong>100x40 mm</strong>, supposedly the size of the material to work on.
Inkscape automatically sets the <strong>user units scale </strong><strong>to
1</strong>. Note that the user units are not "px" or whatever. This means,
<strong>1 "user unit" is equal to 1 mm (and the viewbox is "0 0 100 40" while
width="100mm" and height="40mm")</strong></p>
<img src="Inkscape_settings_mm.png" width="563px"> 

<p>Of course when editing the svg (in Inkscape or in a text editor),
<strong>the user is only concerned with the user units</strong> : he draws a
rectangle of size 20x30 at the location 10x10. The users may simply even not be
aware of this fact. When choosing mm, conversion from <strong>user
units</strong> to <strong>mm</strong> is absolutely straightforward as, as
said, the user units scale is 1 per default .</p>

<p>Let's consider now the case where the user switches to
<strong>inches</strong> for the document size. The size of the document becomes
then <strong>3,93701x1,57480 inches</strong> (yes, 100 / 25.4 is 3.93701). Note
that <strong>Inkscape</strong> automatically change the <strong>user units
scale to 25.4</strong>. Because of this, the <strong>view box remains at "0 0
100 40"</strong>. That way, a rectangle filling the full document size is still
100x40.</p>
<img src="Inkscape_settings_in.png" width="563px"> 

<p>Filling a box half the size of the document is 50x20, right, but what are
real physical dimensions of that box ? The user would have to steadily
calculate from fancy user units (ex: 50x20) in inches</p>

<p>But why would a user use inches and work with user units scale factor 25.4
(leading infact to work in mm) ? The user can set the user units scale factor
to 1. The effect of this is that now, in order to fill the whole document with
a rectangle, the rectangle has to be of the size user unit size of
3.93701x1.57480. </p>

<p>Of course the size of the material is certainly not 3.93701x1.57480 inches,
but something like 5x3 inches: an human readable size. The user knows that he
has to draw a rectangle inside the material of size let say 1.5x1.2 inches. And
these dimensions are the ones that are effectively saved in the svg document.
So the user units are exactly the same as the "physical units" when choosing a
scale of 1.</p>

<p>Now how can <strong>PyCut</strong> handles these settings?
<strong>PyCut</strong> only works with the <strong>user units</strong>.
<strong>PyCut</strong> will calculate toolpaths in the same order of magnitude
of the user units values of the svg. If you choose "<strong>mm</strong>" for
the gcode output, you would have set your svg document size in
"<strong>mm</strong>", and the <strong>user unit scale to 1</strong>. Because
of this, the gcode X,Y and Z values are the same as the one of the paths
values.</p>

<p>If you choose "<strong>in</strong>" for the gcode output, then certainly you
have set your svg document size in "<strong>in</strong>", and the <strong>with
user unit scale equals to 1</strong>,no conversion is either needed.</p>

<p>Note that this scale factor is not explicitely given in the svg file. It is
calculated from the ratio viewbox / width. It is eventually the task of the
user to know what is the user units scale value, and, theorically, to set it in
<strong>PyCut</strong>. But my opinion is, working with a user unit scal of 1
is preferably.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#0000ff">I personnaly stick to svg document units
in "mm" with user units scale factor of 1, and output my gcode in mm. No
confusion! </span></strong></p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: The user could use "mm", and set a scale factor of
10 or whatever, but it certainly makes no sense.</p>
</div>

<p><strong style="color:#0000ff">I apologize for the ones who would like to
work with user units scale not equals to 1.</strong> </p>

<p>The further <strong>PyCut Gcode Units</strong> setting is not only a flag to
set the code <strong>G20</strong> (inches) or <strong>G21</strong> (mm) inside
the gcode file: it also allows the proper conversion of the tool diameter
physical size (inch or mm) in user units.</p>

<p>The rule is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gcode Units</strong> in "mm": tool diameter is transformed to mm
    - the same as the user units</li>
  <li><strong>Gcode Units</strong> in "in": tool diameter is transformed to
    inch - the same as the user units</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: <strong>PyCut</strong> assumes that for
"<strong>mm</strong>" or "<strong>in</strong>", the <strong>user unit scale
factor is always 1</strong> .</p>
</div>

<p></p>

<h3 id="P-04-02">Tool</h3>
<img src="pycut_tool.png" width="310px"> 

<h3 id="P-04-03">Tabs</h3>

<p>It's easy to define tabs with <strong>PyCut</strong>: just click the button
"Create Tab" and a red circle is created in the svg viewer, of radius 5 and
position (10,10). The user can drag 'n drop it fron the svg viewer, or set its
size/postion in the tab table. Yes tabs, for simplicity, are circle. To be
effective, the tabs have to be enabled and of course placed somewhere on the
generated toolpaths. The height of the tab is shared by all tabs.</p>
<img src="./pycut_tabs.png" width="310px"> 

<p></p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Tabs shall not overlap with other tabs (at least
the enabled ones).</p>
</div>

<p>You can check the Gcode generation in the viewer/simulator if everythings is
Ok. </p>

<h3 id="P-04-04">Material</h3>

<p>The Operations "Cut Depth" should not be larger than the material thickness.
</p>
<img src="./pycut_material.png" width="310px"> 

<p></p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Actually no check is performed.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="P-04-05">Curve to Line Conversion</h3>

<p>If your design contain curves (svg "arcs" or "bezier" curves), they have to
be discretized in small segments.</p>

<p>The 2 following parameters allow to specified how fine the curve
discretization will be</p>
<ul>
  <li>Minimun number of segments</li>
  <li>Segment lenght</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="P-04-06">GCode Conversion</h3>

<p>The starting location of a milling operation is given by the initial
location in the GCode. Per default, PyCut gives as starting point the (0,0)
coordinates of the SVG file, which is located at the top-left of the material.
The SVG conventions are opposite to GCode convention considering the Y
direction.</p>

<p>So the GCode generation will have to invert the direction of the Y axis
coordinates. But still the reference is the top-left postion.</p>

<p>It is possible to change the reference location of the generated GCode</p>
<ul>
  <li>Top-Left location of the material</li>
  <li>Bottom-Left location of the material</li>
  <li>Bottom-Left location of the Gcode area</li>
  <li>Center of the Gcode area</li>
</ul>
<img src="./pycut_gcode_conversion.png" width="310px"> 

<p>Note that these 4 buttons act as radio buttons.</p>

<p>These four references points set the XOffset and YOffset of the GCode
calculation. After a GCode generation, it is still possible to modify the
XOffset and YOffset to fit at best how to user wants to have the origin be
located with the help of the 2 spin boxes. </p>

<p>And further:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flip X/Y </li>
</ul>

<p>In the generated G Code, X and Y are switched.This can be helpfull, for
example in the case your <strong>CNC</strong> is the "<strong>1419</strong>"
model (mine!) which is not as large as deep. So this option allows to carve
something like 16x10 cm without to -painfully- rotate all items in the source
svg.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In case of Bottom-Left location of the material, the Y size of the material
is extracted form the svg file: the svg "height" attribute.</p>

<h3 id="P-04-07">GCode Generation</h3>

<p>Some useful options can be set up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Return at initial location at end of the Job</li>
  <li>Spindle Start/Stop (<strong>M3</strong>/<strong>M5</strong> codes)</li>
  <li><strong>M2</strong> code</li>
</ul>
<img src="./pycut_gcode_generation.png" width="310px">
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p></p>

<h3>Create Operations</h3>

<p>This is where the user defined its cam operations, thus this is where the
action takes place.</p>
<img src="./pycut_ops.png" width="1170px"> 

<p>First one or more item(s) have to be selected in the svgviewer, click on
"Create Operation" and a default operation is created. When more than one item
has been selected, the user can perform logical operations on this set of
item</p>
<ul>
  <li>diff</li>
  <li>intersect</li>
  <li>union</li>
  <li>xor</li>
</ul>

<p>When "enabling" this op, the resulting geometry will be displayed ion the
svgviewer</p>

<div class="info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>the geometry is highlighted in red. the highlight
color can be setup in the settings dialog.</p>
</div>

<p>Then the cam operation can be chosen</p>
<ul>
  <li>pocket - only for closed shapes</li>
  <li>inside</li>
  <li>outside</li>
  <li>engrave</li>
  <li>drill <strong><span style="color:#0000ff">ONLY</span> <span
    style="color:#0000ff">for circle shapes</span></strong></li>
  <li>peck <strong><span style="color:#0000ff">ONLY for circle
    shape</span></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For opened paths, the pocket/drill/peck operations are not available.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#8000ff">NEW</span></strong>: for
<strong>circles</strong>, "<span
style="color:#8000ff"><strong>drill</strong></span>" and "<strong><span
style="color:#8000ff">peck</span></strong>" operations are available. Infact,
for a pocket operation with a circle of diameter smaller than the cutter
diameter, no tool path would be generated.<strong>In case of the</strong>
<strong>circle diameter is smaller or equal than the cutter diameter</strong>,
in order to have toolpath, "<strong><span
style="color:#8000ff">drill</span></strong>" or "<strong><span
style="color:#8000ff">peck</span></strong>" is the way to go. </p>

<p></p>

<p>In order to generate G code, enable one or many operations and click on
"Generate G code". <strong>PyCut</strong> will try to do its best... The
resulting G code is displayed in the G code viewer and G code simulator.</p>

<p>Finally, clicking on "Save G code" will produce a valid G code file.
<strong>Candle</strong> can be used to send the G code to your machine. Have
fun...</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h3 id="P-05">Appendix-1: SVG Editors</h3>

<p>It seems there are plenty of free SVG editors around there. Well, let me
share my opinion about a few of them...</p>

<p>I will simply try to edit and save a closed path composed of lines, arcs and bezier curves
similar to what I 've edited per hand: about 20 segments representing my workpiece.</p>

<h4>Inkscape</h4>

<p>To me much too complicated. I "hate" the fact that the
circles are given from their "bounding box", not from the center with radius
(ok it is possible, but I have always to figure out how). <strong>Editing paths
is far to complicated</strong> (to me) and thus too difficult. The saved SVG data is
full of <strong>inkscape/sodipodi namespaces</strong> stuff, which I dislike a
lot in a SVG file. I would rather prefer a raw SVG with only the minimal and
certainly not all these extra namespace stuff. Removing per hand these extra stuff
destroy the Inkscape project settings. </p>

<p>Yeappy! To obtain a SVG data free of sodipodi/inkscape namespace stuff, you have to "export" 
your SVG data as SVG!</p>

<p>Editing points coordinates "per hand" is nearly impossible as the coordinates are only 
accessible from the "d" string, which is not really human readable. Here is an example of a polyline with 8 points:</p>

<code><pre>M 5.9999998,35.999999 10,33 l 5,2.999999 -1,-4 h 7 V 41 H 12 L 8.9999999,38.999998</pre></code>

<p>Note how absolute and relative keywords are given in the path. Question: what are the coordinates of the fifth point?</p>

<p>Concatening segments to form a single path doesn't even work as expected. 
The simple task consisting of concatenating a polyline and a bezier curve -in this order- 
(which are joined) seems not to work! There is the "combine" command,
but the result is a single path (ok... ) containing 2 subpaths (with "M"), which is not Ok, 
the first one beeing the bezier curve and the second one beeing the polyline, 
this means in reversed order. Sure, with "M"s everywhere, the ordering is not that important, is it!
<strong>A very desapointing implementation from Inkscape I would say</strong>.
Conclusion: <strong>unusable if you want to generate complex paths.</strong></p>

<p>PS: There is the "Draw Bezier and straight line tool" with mode "Create regular Bezier path" 
but after many many hours of trial (despize YouTube tutorials)I did not succeed to use it properly. 
Is it just me ? With it you cannot anyway mix your path with an arc curve.</p>

<h4>QCAD</h4>

<p>It reads/writes <strong>dxf</strong> files, can export them as SVG.
Unfortunately the <strong>SVG export</strong> comes with extra rubbish for the
trial version (nice!). Forget the free version. Editing polylines is possible,
as well as Arcs and Cubic Bezier curves (but Quadratic Bezier curves are not supported).
These Cubic Bezier curves are exported right in the SVG export. Unfortunately (again),
when concatening lines/polylines with these cubic bezier curves in order to
form a whole path, they are transformed into Arcs (why ?), and so the SVG
export. Conclusion: <strong>unusable if you need Bezier curves in paths.</strong></p>

<h4>LibreCAD   **BEST**</h4>

<p>It is (was) a fork of QCAD (2011), but the authors did not manage a lot,
except porting it (as QCAD did) to Qt-5 and polishing the UI with their own taste.
It looks a lot like QCAD, but at first sight the user interface seems (to me) a little bit better.
The SVG export is exactly what one expects. There is minimal extra librecad namespace stuff in the output.
Do not know yet how to assign ids to the entities.
You only have to take care that in SVG y = 0 is the top of the drawing, so coordinates in the SVG are somehow
inverted from coordinates in the app. y = 0 correspond to the highest coordinates of your items in the canvas.</p>

<p> Splines through 3 points correspond to bezier quadratic curves.
In the GUI, the middle point of the curve is entered, not the "control point". 
There is btw infortunately no cubic bezier curves.</p>

<p>Editing polylines/arcs/quad bezier and concatenate them together ("create polyline from existing segments") is excellent,
even if there is here a bug: one cannot concatenate polylines/arcs with the quad bezier curves. </p>

<p>Snap stuff is perfect.</p>

<strong><p>So this is a real pity that LibreCAD does not support Cubic Bezier Curves (and the minor bug).</strong>
Conclusion: <strong>The best SVG generator/editor so far.</strong></p> 

<h4>XFig</h4>

<p>My beloved drawing editor during my youth! Completely outdated, but still
the best! Unfortunately the SVG export is deficient. There are Bezier curves (really?)
i.e. splines with control points (it looks like Bezier) but the SVG outputs them as 
polylines. <strong>Conclusion: unusable</strong></p>

<h4>DesignCAD</h4>
<p>The free version has the same capabilities as the full version, excepted the exports to other formats.
Thank you and see you next time!</p>

<h4>TurboCAD</h4>
<p>15 Days trial version - TODO</p>

<h4>Solid Edge 2D Drafting (Siemens)</h4>
<p>The 3.8 GB big app from Siemens is free of charge. It seems there is no SVG export at all. "Schade".</p>

<h4>Draftsight 2D (Dassault)</h4>
<p>Only a 30 day trial. TO SEE. Oh my God! there is this "Power Tool" named "2D G-Code generator"! 
Forget this tool!!
</p>

<h4>What else?</h4>

<p>It is cumbersome to try to find a decent SVG editor, or at least a CAD
program with ease of use and decent SVG export. LibreCAD would be simply perfect if it would
support Bezier curves (keeping dxf as input data alongside svg as export data would not be a problem). 
Does anyone knows one? (I mean, if he/she **really** tried it and can recommand it). </p>

<h4>Online editors</h4>

<p>There are plenty of them, but I do not like online tools... They also seems
to be meant for painting, not for CAD. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p> The fact that it is so difficult to find an acceptable SVG path "writer" program can only be 
due to the SVG format itself, which is completely "user" or "app" un-friendly. The path definition 
is too complicated. What is the point of allowing paths with sub-paths? 
maybe because the SVG format completely ignores the concept of "multiline"/"multipolygon" etc. 
Polygons have no "interiors" so they must be defined as such in a path composed of 2 subpaths for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>All in all very desapointing!</strong></p>

<h4><span style="color:#0000ff">Per hand</span></h4>

<p>Finally my prefered method! Per hand you can also write items in the
<code>&lt;def&gt;</code> section, and use these items repeatidly with
transformations with the <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> tag. My utility
<strong>svgresolver.py</strong> then transforms this svg file into another one,
usable for <strong>PyCut. Not the perfect toolchain I admit, but well my svgs
are not that complicated</strong>. You have to understand how to write an
arc/bezier curve per hand, it is not that difficult. And yours svgs are then
"<strong>clean</strong>".</p>
