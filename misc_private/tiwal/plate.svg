	<!--
	The vise has 3 parts, all joined by 2 shafts (8mm diameter), where in the middle part
	the shafts are enclosed with bearings (15mm diameter).
	
	The middle part is "floating" while the two others parts are fixed by screws to the base.
	
	The holes for these 2 shafts must be perfectly aligned on the 3 parts, 
	as well as the 2 holes in parts 1 and 2 for the leadscrew.
	
	The holes for the shafts are not centered, as the middle part must be cut-off (as the last part) 
	to clamp the workpiece of a height of 3 mm (and a width of 6mm).
	The "secondary clamp" has a width of 3 mm and an height of 20mm. 
	
	Note that for the leadscrew the hole must be a little translated in direction of the top of the bar, because 
	the hand handle (where the human hand acts in order to screw/unscrew) has a diameter of 2cm so it has to be 
	"elevated" sonce the handle will be very unpracticable.
	
	The leadscrew passes through a backlash item so we name this hole the backlash hole.
	the leadscrew hole is 10.3 mm diameter for the part1 and 15mm for the middle part.
	
	We also display the plan for a fixed part (there are 2 of them) which are screwed to the machine.
	The view for this part is from above, while the view for the two parts with shaft is from the side.
