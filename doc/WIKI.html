<h1 class="etitle">PyCut Wiki</h1>

<p><strong>PyCut</strong> is a clone of <strong>jsCut</strong>, the excellent (at least for beginners) 
CAM, web-based programm, that takes as input svg files and generates G-Code. 
So why this rewrite ?</p>

<p>One reason is: I wanted the spindle control (M3/M5) codes inside 
the generated g-code. It is worth a rewrite!</p>

<p>So it begins as a "fun" project, in order to understand how a G-code generator
works, and how easy (or hard) it is to achieve. Well, it is not so easy 
(but stealing jsCut code helps). And I learned about jsCut through the 
<a href="https://cncphilosophy.com/svg-to-G-Code">CnC Philosophy</a> pages.</p>

<p>By the way,I began to use <strong>jsCut</strong> because <strong>Easel</strong> (for beginners too),
although free, makes limitations (among others) on the choices of the fonts
- which is quite a shame...</p>

<p>An other point is (to me) the "major" shortcoming of <strong>jsCut</strong>: the fact that it is a web
application: sure for developpers who know javascript technology it is very
productive, but how many users are able to improve <strong>jsCut</strong> on their own? only a
few I guess: it is not as easy as one may think. This is due to my opinion to
the fact javascript/html frameworks are just a pain to understand for people not
used to the web technologies (which by the way change lets say every 3 years...). 
Traditional desktop applications are a lot easier to hack (yes!)</p>

<p>Web technologies change every 3 years? Consider <strong>jsCut</strong> GUI itself, which is
based on the "polymer" HTML framework, which is (used to be) an excellent framework. 
Who which is new to javascript has ever heard of this lib before?! It is even not that old! 
And "polymer" is also based on so-called "html
imports", which are in 2022 theoretically no more allowed (as far as know)... 
How many html files/lines of code are neccessary 
to achieve the task, compared to, when written in python, only a few Qt Ui files 
for the design and the python main program having max 1000 lines of code? 
(Ok,there are other files around).
I believe as well that the python code is also much easier to understand
than the <strong>jsCut</strong> code. Nothing at all against <strong>jsCut</strong>, it is just the web stuff.</p>

<p>So PyCut is written in python, with the GUI with PySide6. I actually use Python-3.9. 
It can be of importance for the Clipper SWIG wrapper. It seems different versions of python
load DLL differently. In all cases, for Python-3.9 it seems that, for windows, some mingw64 libs are required alongside the 
generated .pyd wrapper. These few libs have been pushed in the repository. I did not try wrappers for linux/macos.</p>

<p>Hopefully there will be users that will be able to contribute. There is a developper doc for 
this purpose (<span style="color:#ff0080">TODO</span>)</p>

<p>The excellent things from <strong>jsCut</strong> are (among others):</p>
<ul>
  <li>a great svg viewer, with an API to add svg path(s) to the viewer content:
	  <ul>
	    <li>in black the regions of the geometry that will be affected</li>
	    <li>in green the calculated toolpaths</li>
	  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a great gcode simulator -in webgl-</li>
  <li>the CAM stuff, based on the Clipper library as well as some c++ code with js wrapper:
     hopefully a swig wrapper or something equivalent is feasible</li>
</ul>

<p>So the idea is the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MainWindow in PySide <span style="color:#00a000"> DONE</span></li>
  <li>in PySide, display the SVG viewer stuff (QGraphicsView with SvgItem) <span style="color:#00a000"> DONE (geometry previews, toolpaths)</span></li>
  <li>in PySide, display the WebGL stuff (QEngineView)<span style="color:#00a000"> DONE</span></li>
  <li>G-Code Generation (lot of js code to understand) <span style="color:#00a000"> DONE</span></li>
  <li>G-Code generation with spindle control (actually absent in <strong>jsCut</strong> -wow! what a feature!-) <span style="color:#00a000">DONE</span></li>
  <li>G-Code viewer (as in Candle) <span style="color:#00a000"> DONE</span></li>
</ul>

<p>After that</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tabs handling ? (cam c++ wrapper + js code, nothing done at this point) <span style="color:#ff0080">TODO</span></li>
  <li>Migrating WebGL stuff to "native" python ? (QtOpenGL) <span style="color:#ff0080">TODO</span></li>
  <li>Toolpaths for vPocket operations ? (cam c++ wrapper, nothing done at this point) <span style="color:#ff0080">TODO</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Infact, as far as I have understood, the tabs have to be created in the original svg,
and this is not very practical. It would be nicer to make as in <strong>GrblGru</strong> 
where the tabs are simply set "on the fly" on the svg view by indicating how many tabs one wishes
(with their "types": ROUND etc. plus height/length). They then appear on the viewer and can
be interactively dragged (Correction: they are not draggable) on the toolpath.</p>
<p>This is how the tabs should be implemented I think. So the svg viewer has to be 
more widget-like and interactiv.</p>
<p>But of course, when done, the gcode generation will be -again- stolen from jsCut...</p>
