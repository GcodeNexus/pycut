<h3>SVG Text to Paths Conversion</h3>

<p></p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The conversion of text given in svg files (element <code>&lt;text&gt;</code>) to paths (element
<code>&lt;path&gt;</code>) seems to be a common concern. There are in Internet plenty of projects/discussions on the
topic.</p>

<p>For every language it seems that many solutions are given. Unfortunately, as far as I could observe, there is plenty
of crap. This is especially the case when searching for solutions for the python language (which is quite a shame)!</p>

<p></p>

<p>I finally found only <strong>1 (!)</strong> python package that seems to make the conversion in a reasonable way:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ziafont (version 0.2)</strong> (as 15.01.2022)</li>
</ul>

<p>This package reads the true type font binary files (which is a whole task in its own) and thus has access to every
bit of the files. Paths can then be calculated and exported. A quick try shown me how good this package is. Diving into
the code shows how deep the author of the package knows true type stuff. I only found one drawback: the output is full
of "viewbox" fitting exactly the size of the output paths, and these viewboxes are often with negative values. Because
of this, it is not so straightforward (for me) to use the output and to plug it into the user own svg file as one would
wish. This is because I personnaly prefer in svg file only 1 viewbox definition (at the top) starting at (0, 0) with
<strong>w</strong> and <strong>h</strong> equals to the svg "<strong>width</strong>" and "<strong>height</strong>".
Negative <strong>x</strong> or <strong>y</strong> viewboxes are simply a pain.</p>

<p></p>

<p>An other method would be to use the python package "<strong>freetype-py</strong>". This package performs the task of
reading the binary files, and it is possible to generate the paths from the structures/objects that freetype-py offers.
These are infact ctypes wrappers, and as a good (excellent) wrapper, many functions of the freetype c library are
accessible as methods of these objects. Hopefully all informations of the fonts are accessible!</p>

<p>This is the approach that I follow in my package, and because of this, my code is much smaller than the
<strong>ziafont</strong> one. But I am quite sure that <strong>ziafont</strong> is much more robust/bug free as my
<strong>svgtext2svgpaths</strong> package. Naming <strong>svgtext2svgpaths</strong> a package is anyway not quite
right, it is simply one single file.</p>

<p></p>

<h4>The svgtext2svgpaths package</h4>

<p>The features of my package are directly dictated from the need to convert svg &lt;text&gt; to svg &lt;path&gt;
elements. How does the result of the conversion has to look like?</p>
<ul>
  <li>It must be <strong>without</strong> any "<strong>transforms</strong>" attributes.</li>
  <li>the <strong>location</strong> of the text described by the path(s) must match exactly the same input &lt;text&gt;
    which is given in svg by the "<strong>x</strong>" and "<strong>y</strong>" attributes.</li>
  <li>the <strong>size</strong> of the letters described by the paths must be exactly the same as the one given in the
    &lt;text&gt; data: the style "<strong>font-size</strong>" expressed in user units "<strong>px</strong>".</li>
  <li>and of course, font <strong>family</strong> and <strong>type</strong> must be respected, as far as possible (font
    files must be found on the computer).</li>
</ul>

<p>It cannot handle the following strings:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>strings splitted on many lines</strong></li>
  <li><strong>empty space in strings (?)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3><strong>Usage</strong></h3>

<h4>Font properties</h4>

<p>From Inkscape, inside the GUI, a text element is entered. for example "Xavier". The font family / type can be chosen
as well as the font-size, given in "<strong>pt</strong>". Saving this file, we can observe in the svg file that the svg
font size is different than the one in the GUI.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Example: In Inkscape, give as font size <strong>30 pt</strong>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Units conversion are as following:</p>

<p>https://oreillymedia.github.io/Using_SVG/guide/units.html</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 px = 3/4 pt</li>
  <li>1 inch = 25.4 mm</li>
  <li>Inkscape resolution: 96 px per inch</li>
</ul>

<p>From these values : 30 pt are 40 px are (40/96) * 25.4 mm = <strong>10.5833</strong>. This is the value found in the
svg file, with units "<strong>px</strong>".</p>

<p></p>

<p>Whatever the conversion is, we have anyway the font-size in the svg file and we will use it for the conversion to
<code>&lt;paths&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>As input we also have the font family and style (in the "style" attribute), as well as the string, the value of the
text. It can be set as value of the XML <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element, or as value(s) of the XML
<code>&lt;tspan&gt;</code> element(s) found inside the <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>So a converter has to correctly parse the XML <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element.</p>

<h4>Font Files</h4>

<p>Next, we need something like a "lookup" to find the <strong>ttf</strong> files from the given font family and style.
Font files are located per default in windows in:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>C:\\Windows\\Fonts</code></li>
</ul>

<p>All the font files found there are read to extract the family and style, as these two informations does not
neccessarely appear the the font files name.It should be also possible to specify other folders where other font files
are stored. </p>

<p>In case of the svg font family and style are not found in the lookup data, a default font should be loaded.</p>

<p></p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code>
# -- from a real svg data
# ---- there can be many &lt;text&gt; tags in the svg file

manager = SvgTextManager("C:\\.....\\svg\\B.svg")
paths = manager.convert_strings()

for string_paths in paths:
    print("&lt;!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ --&gt;")
    print("&lt;!-- ----------- STRING CONVERSION ------------------------------------ --&gt;")
    print("&lt;"-- ------------------------------------------------------------------- -&gt;")

    for k, path in enumerate(string_paths):

        print('&lt;path id="%d" style="fill:#ff0000;fill-opacity:0.5;" d="%s" /&gt;' % (k, path.d()))
        print("&lt;!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- --&gt;")
        
# end</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>As you can see, conversion is straightforward. Especially, there are no spurious viewboxes around. You can copy from
the console the output and paste it in the original svg.</p>

<p>All strings should overlap!</p>
